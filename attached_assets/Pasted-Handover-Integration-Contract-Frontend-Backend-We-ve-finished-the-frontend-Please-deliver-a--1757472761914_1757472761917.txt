Handover & Integration Contract (Frontend → Backend)

We’ve finished the frontend. Please deliver a backend-integration handover containing:

API Contract

Endpoint list with methods/paths.

Zod/OpenAPI schemas for requests/responses/errors.

Pagination + filter params (names, defaults, sort keys).

Error codes the UI expects.

Types & Models

TS types for: Product, Brand, Category, ProductVariant, VariantPacking, Shipment, ShipmentItem, Inquiry, Settings.

Required vs optional fields; ID/slug rules.

Hook Layer

Expose all React Query hooks used: names, parameters, examples, cache keys, invalidation rules, optimistic update behavior.

List which hooks must switch from fixtures → real API and where to change the base URL.

UI States

Conditions for loading/empty/error/disabled states.

URL param mapping for search and filters.

Auth/Roles

Which screens require auth.

Role gates (Owner/Manager/Editor) baked into UI and expected server checks.

Uploads (if any)

Contract for image upload (signed URL vs direct POST), expected return shape.

Config

.env.example with all keys the frontend reads.

Feature flags/settings (esp. priceVisible) and where they’re consumed.

Fixtures/Mocks

Ship the exact fixture JSONs used (products, brands, shipments, inquiries, settings) and any MSW/mock config.

Docs

README (run steps, providers, folder map).

Style/design tokens and accessibility notes used by components.

Smoke Tests

Provide cURL or Postman requests for: products list/detail; inquiries (POST with WhatsApp number); shipments create/update/addItem/deleteItem; settings get/patch.

Deliver all of the above in a /handover folder:

/handover/openapi.json (or Zod schemas).

/handover/types.d.ts

/handover/hooks.md (with examples)

/handover/fixtures/*.json

/handover/.env.example

/handover/README.md

/handover/smoke-tests.postman_collection.json (optional)

Our backend will implement the endpoints to exactly match your contract, then we’ll flip the hooks from fixtures to live URLs.
